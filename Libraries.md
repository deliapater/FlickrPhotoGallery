# Libraries

`Bulma` is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 150,000 developers.

`bad-words` is a javascript filter for bad words.

`axios` is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser that also supports the ES6 Promise API.

`striptags` is an implementation of PHP's strip_tags in Node.js.

`lodash.debounce`, Debounce functions are included in many JavaScript libraries. The goal behind each implementation is to reduce overhead by preventing a function from being called several times in succession. Regardless of the library, all debounce functions are built on JavaScriptâ€™s native setTimeout function. Understanding specifically how they work can be difficult. While typically small in size, debounce functions take advantage of some pretty advanced JavaScript concepts like closures and execution queues.
